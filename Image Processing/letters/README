[4]For any help ask me or dig through the code. The parameter tuning can be done to acheived the desired result. 

[5]The parameters will depend on the kind of dataset. If the doesn't work as expexted tune the following parameter.

if r > 0.4 and w > 8 and h > 8 and w < 300:
        cv2.rectangle(mask, (x, y), (x+w-1, y+h-1), (146,255,255), 1)
        cv2.drawContours(fmask, contours, idx, 255, -1)

Try to tune the if condition parametres like 0.4 or 8 or 300. These parameter dependes upon the size of the image and also the child contours[3].

[6]Similiarly shape of kernel can be changed.

kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_ELLIPSE, (3, 3))
kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_RECT, (9,1))

[7]for the function cv2.findcontours, u can make use of cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL/CV2.RETR_CCOMP or RETR_LIST. 
I am using RETR_CCOMP. If it is not giving correct result u can change it.You can reda about it in [3].
For image1 use RETR_EXTERNAL. for image2 use RETR_CCOMP.
